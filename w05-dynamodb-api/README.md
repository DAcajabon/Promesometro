# Example 05 - Serverless Database with DynamoDB + API Gateway

Now we are doing the same we did with our translation service but now with DynamoDB.   

### 1. Let's deploy the example:

* cd w05-dynamodb-api
* serverless deploy

### 2. You will see two endpoints, open yuor browser and use it to read the data: 

* http://YOUR-READ-ENDPOINT?name=<NAME>
* Ex.: https://9pudgqssn0.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/read_glucose?name=Francisco Xavier

### 3. To add new glucose data use the add_glucose endpoint:

* http://YOUR-ADD-ENDPOINT?name=Francisco Xavier&glucose=95
* Ex.: https://9pudgqssn0.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/add_glucose?name=Francisco Xavier&glucose=95

### IMPORTANT NOTE: usually a REST API will use GET, PUT, DELETE and other HTTP methods to represent the actions. We are using HTTP GET just for convinience to test it.
